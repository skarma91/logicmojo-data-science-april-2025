It should also have a method `check_out()` that marks the book as checked out and a method `check_in()` that marks it as available.\n",
    "- The `Patron` class should have attributes for name and patron ID and a method `borrow_book(book)` that associates a book with the patron.\n",
    "- The `Library` class should have a collection of `Book` objects and `Patron` objects. It should have methods to `add_book(book)`, `add_patron(patron)`, `lend_book(book, patron)`, and `return_book(book)`. The `lend_book` method should only allow a book to be lent if it's available and the patron exists in the library.\n",
