# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: [Electric Production Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shenba/time-series-datasets/data). 
    - The dataset is provided in this github folder for your reference.
    - **about the dataset**: 
        - IPG2211A2N is the series identifier for Industrial Production: Utilities – Electric and Gas Utilities. 
        - It covers the output (production) of U.S. electric utilities and gas utilities (NAICS sectors 2211 and 2212) as tracked by the Federal Reserve.

- **Objective**: The objective is to apply **classical time series analysis** techniques to explore, model, and forecast real-world data.  

- **Skills Practiced**:
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Visualization
    - Time Series Decomposition techniques
    - Moving averages
    - ETS methods
    - ARMA and ARIMA modeling

## Deliverables
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report**  
   - Time plots, decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals).  
   - Summary statistics and discussion of stationarity.  

2. **Preprocessing Steps**  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and transformations (if needed).  
   - Stationarity checks (ADF/KPSS tests) and differencing/transformations applied.  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Fit **classical models** (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters).  
   - Perform parameter tuning and diagnostics.  

4. **Forecasting**  
   - Generate out-of-sample forecasts with proper train-test split.  
   - Compare models based on accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).  

5. **Final Report**  
   - Clear explanation of modeling decisions.  
   - Visualization of forecasts vs. actuals.  
   - Insights and conclusions on model performance.

## Suggested Milestones
- **Problem setup and EDA:** Dataset selection, problem statement definition, initial EDA.  
- **Preprocessing and decomposition:** Preprocessing, trend/seasonality decomposition, stationarity checks.  
- **Naive model fitting:** Model fitting (baseline models like Naïve, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing).  
- **Advanced Model fitting:** Advanced models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters), diagnostics, and validation.  
- **Forecasting:** Forecast generation, accuracy evaluation, visualization.  
- **Report Preparation:** Write project report & polish notebook for readability.
