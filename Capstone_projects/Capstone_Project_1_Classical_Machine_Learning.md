# **Capstone Project-1: Forest Cover Type Prediction**

---

## **Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to predict the type of forest cover (categorical variable with seven possible types) based on cartographic variables such as elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and wilderness area. The goal is to build an efficient classification model that accurately identifies the forest cover type from the provided geographical and environmental features.

This problem is based on the **UCI Forest Cover Type dataset**, which contains cartographic variables derived from the US Geological Survey and US Forest Service data.

## **Objectives**

1. Perform detailed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationships and distributions among features.
2. Implement **data preprocessing**, including scaling and handling any potential data imbalance.
3. Train multiple classification models and compare their performances.
4. Tune hyperparameters of the best-performing model for optimal results.
5. Evaluate models using multiple metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Draw insights and provide a data-driven conclusion.

## **Steps to Follow**

### **1. Data Loading and Inspection**

- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Check for missing values and data types.
- Display basic statistics.
- Inspect the target variable distribution.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualize continuous feature distributions (histograms, boxplots).
- Correlation analysis using heatmap.
- Explore class imbalance in target labels.
- Plot relationships between elevation and forest cover type.
- Analyze feature importance trends and geographic correlations.

### **3. Data Preprocessing**

- **Feature Scaling:** Apply standardization to continuous variables.
- **Feature Encoding:** Wilderness_Area and Soil_Type are already one-hot encoded.
- **Train-Test Split:** Use 80-20 split for training and testing.
- **Class Imbalance:** Check if balancing techniques (like SMOTE or class weights) are needed.

### **4. Model Building**

Train multiple classification algorithms, like:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier
- Neural Networks

Use cross-validation to compare results. Also make sure the model can gracefully handle the class imbalance if exists.

### **5. Model Evaluation**

Evaluate all models using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC (if applicable for multi-class setup)

### **6. Hyperparameter Tuning**

Perform hyperparameter optimization for the best model using:
- GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- Track model performance before and after tuning.

### **7. Feature Importance Analysis**

- Identify the most important features contributing to predictions.
- Implement feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Visualize feature importances for tree-based models.

### **8. Final Model Selection and Testing**

- Select the best-performing model based on test performance.
- Report classification results on the test set.
- Compare training vs testing performance to assess overfitting.
